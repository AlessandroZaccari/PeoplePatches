# PeoplePatches
From the Semantic Drone Dataset we created a People Dataset that contains images with one person each and black background. People from this dataset are then partially occlused and used to add People Patches to existing images, with the purpose of having a more robust training for person detection algorithms.

Example of data augmentation:
